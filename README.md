# Seb's Collection of Mathematical Procedures

This repository is a personal collection of preparation notes and worked procedures for the Mat 1A exam at DTU (Technical University of Denmark). It contains concise explanations, step-by-step solution templates, and example problems intended to help revision and practice leading up to the exam.

---

## Purpose
- Collect and organise core methods needed for Mat 1A.
- Provide quick-reference procedures (how to approach common problem types).
- Save worked examples and exam-style practice for efficient revision.
- Serve as informal, personal prep notes — not a formal course substitute.

---

## What you'll find here
- Short, focused notes on core topics (algebra, trigonometry, calculus basics, equations, vectors, etc.).
- Step-by-step worked procedures for common problem types (e.g., solving equations, differentiation rules, integrals, trigonometric identities).
- Example problems with solutions and commentary on pitfalls to avoid.
- A simple folder structure grouping topics for quick navigation.

---

## Suggested study workflow
1. Skim the "summary" notes for a topic to refresh the theory.
2. Work through 2–4 worked examples and attempt at least one similar problem without looking.
3. Time yourself on a selection of problems to simulate exam conditions.
4. Create a short cheat-sheet of formulas and methods (for personal use — the real exam rules apply).
5. Revisit mistakes and add clarifying notes to the relevant file in this repo.

## Repo structure (example)
- /algebra — linear equations, quadratic formula, manipulation tips
- /trigonometry — identities, unit-circle reminders, common transformations
- /calculus — derivatives, integrals, basic techniques, examples
- /vectors — basics, operations, geometric interpretations
- /examples — mixed problems and exam-style sets
- /cheatsheets — printable summary pages for quick revision

(Note: actual folder names and files may vary — explore the repository tree for exact contents.)

## Study tips specific to Mat 1A @ DTU
- Practice algebraic manipulation until it feels routine — most mistakes come from small algebra errors.
- Memorise standard derivatives and integrals and practise applying chain/product/quotient rules quickly.
- For trigonometry, focus on graph shapes, key angles, and basic identities (double-angle, sum/difference).
- Solve past exams under timed conditions. Review the marking scheme to understand what partial credit is awarded.
- Keep a list of "common mistakes" and check it before submitting an answer.

## Contributing or adapting for your own study
This repo was created as personal prep notes. If you want to adapt, reorganise, or add your own solutions:
- Fork the repository and add files in topic folders.
- Keep examples clear and include short commentary on method and common pitfalls.
- If sharing publicly, respect academic integrity — do not use this to distribute completed take-home or otherwise restricted assessments.
